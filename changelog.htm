Features:

Implementation of playing as both white and black pieces, allowing users to choose their preferred side.
Incorporation of a resign feature, enabling users to concede the game if they decide to surrender.
Detection and handling of the 50-move rule, stalemate, checkmate, and three-fold repetition scenarios to ensure accurate game outcomes.
Ability to play custom positions using FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation), allowing users to set up specific board configurations.
Integration of ten different time controls for the engine, providing a variety of playing speeds to cater to users' preferences.
Implementation of a move take-back functionality, allowing users to undo their previous moves and explore alternative strategies.
Addition of three different board color options to customize the visual appearance of the chessboard.
Enhancement of the engine's search algorithm to reach a depth of eight plies (half-moves) within one second, enabling it to analyze positions more deeply.
Optimization of node calculations to handle approximately 860,000 nodes per second, allowing for more efficient evaluation and decision-making.
Known Bugs:

Inability to flip the board, preventing users from viewing the board from the opposite perspective.
Inaccurate scoring or evaluation of positions, which may lead to suboptimal moves or misjudgments by the engine.
Lack of drag and drop functionality for moving pieces, requiring users to input moves manually.
Failure to highlight clicked pieces when the board color is changed, potentially causing confusion during gameplay.
Minor misalignment of the chessboard by one to three pixels, affecting the visual presentation of the game interface.
Limited availability of only ten different time controls for the engine, potentially restricting users who prefer specific time settings.
