<h3>Info</h3> 
<p>
In a chess engine, the term "kn/s" stands for "kilo-nodes per second." 
It is a measurement of the engine's computational speed or processing power.
Nodes in chess represent different positions or states that the engine considers 
during its search for the best move. Each node represents a potential move or a position 
resulting from a series of moves. The engine evaluates these nodes to determine the best move.

"kilo" refers to a factor of 1,000, so "kn/s" means "thousands of nodes per second." 
 In the case of "947.34 kn/s," it means that the chess engine is capable of evaluating 
 roughly 947,340 nodes in one second. The higher the kn/s value, the faster the engine 
 can analyze positions and make decisions.
  
Also ply = depth
<p>

<h3>Play</h3>
<p>
Play a game of chess against Chessler V3. By default you will be playing with the
white pieces. Use the Play menu to change colour and start or restart a new game
with with the black or white pieces.  You can do this at any time.
<p>
You can change how well Chessler plays at any time - including during a game - by using
the Strength menu.  If you find you are making mistakes, try using a
lower strength.
<p>
While Chessler is thinking some information is shown above the board and after Chessler V3
has moved the information will look something like this:-
<p><b>1 s | 948.29 kn | 947.34 kn/s | 0.1%</b>
<p><b>1 s</b> is the time Chessler V3 took to move. <b>948.29 kn</b> can be thought of as
the total number of moves Chessler V3 analysed while making his move. <b>947.34 kn/s</b> is the number of moves
analysed per second. <b>0.1%</b> is the percentage of his internal memory used so far.

<p>
The Analyse button will open a new web page allowing you to analyse the current position.
Both web pages will be active. It's easier to bounce between play and analyse pages using a
laptop rather than a phone.

<h3>Optional URL parameters</h3>

<p><b>c=b</b>
<p>You play black. Default is you play white.

<p><b>l=<i>1 to 10</i></b>
<p>Sets the initial strength.  Default is level 1 (<i>l=1</i>)

<p><b>fen=<i>fen</i></b>
<p>Use the specified FEN string to start the game from. The default is the standard start position.

<p><b>m=<i>ucigocommand</i></b>
<p>Chessler V3 uses the given UCI go command to make his move rather than that for the selected level. For example to ask Chessler V3
to search to a depth of 2 ply only use:-
<p><a href="https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go depth 2">https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go depth 2</a>
<p>Another example, to ask Chessler V3 to make his move after searching 100000 nodes, use:-
<p><a href="https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go nodes 100000">https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go nodes 100000</a>
<p>To make Chessler V3 move after a certain time specify the time in milliseconds, e.g. 200ms use:-
<p><a href="https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go movetime 200">https://chessler-engine-v3.vercel.app/play.htm?m=go movetime 200</a>
<p>When the m parameter is present the strength menu has no effect.
